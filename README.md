JavaScript Shopping Cart

Simple shopping cart functionality, where page content is fetched from a local JSON and dynamically displayed on the home page. All the products and the cart content is stored in the local storage, which resets after adding products, incrementing/decrementing the amount of them and by clearing the whole cart.
